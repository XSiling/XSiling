### More about ME
In my spare time, I love photographing. You can access to some of my photos through the url in my profile. The world in an image is amazing.

Playing games makes me relaxed, I love ACG, JRPG, the Battle Flag. I have dived into steam, switch and mobile games. I'm also a player of the popular Honor of Kings ^^.

Generally I love helping others, which makes me feel calm.
